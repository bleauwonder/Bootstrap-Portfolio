                <p>Elyza is what is truly called a Renaissance Woman. She's an accomplished musician, who started her career in college honing her craft of classical French horn 
                and singing musical theatre tunes. But after 11 years of french horn and music theory, she dropped it all to sing rock n’ roll and jam on her tenor ukulele. The 
                pulses of distortion kept ringing in her ear, and she's been enjoying rocking out on a good old Truetone from the 60s ever since.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Having been versed in the art of improv at the Groundlings, learning sitcom and audition technique at Scott Sedita studios, and performing in both the 
                Cricket Feet Showcase and the Twenty-Something Showcase, Elyza has a strong foundation for great funny moments. She’s even done stand up at the Comedy Store. 
                But nonetheless, Elyza’s flair for drama is still alive and well. She also studied at AMDA, getting to sing, dance, and act all day long for musical theatre.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Not just one for performing, Elyza also lives on an urban farm in NYC, and slings hot sauce and teachable moments on the weekends. During the week, she's scouring
                the world of the boroughs to find the best and brightest providers for a nonprofit supporting people with disabilities.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>When she’s not doing anything of those things, Elyza can be seen coding like a mad woman, step dancing or doing yoga everywhere around NYC, flying on a trapeze, 
                on another new adventure, or getting intimate with strangers with street photography.</p>
